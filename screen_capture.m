function screen_capture(movie_name,recording_time)
%Can be used to record any screen activity and output
%the recorded actions as video file (MOVIE.avi). It also saves the frames used to
%create the movie in a jpg format frames. The images are named as
%scrcapture -frame number- .jpg
%For example the first frame is named scrcapture1.jpg
%The recording time is almost identical to the actual cpu time.
%The quality of the video is excellent, but the size is big. One is advised
%to record short videos(order of minutes).For even better quality, one could replace the
% png format to jpg(simply uncomment the respective commands).
%                      to call the function, one types:
%
%                                            screen_capture(movie_name,recording_time)
%                     where
%   movie_name: is a string representing the name of  the movie
%   recording_time: is the length of the capturing (in seconds)
%To try, one might use the following example:
%                                                                 screen_capture('movie',30)
%When the code is done writing the movie, a gong sound will be played
%to inform the user that the movie is finished.
